## Exercise 1

- Create new S3 bucket with the following requirements:
1. Region: Frankfurt (eu-central-1)
- Upload a cat picture to your bucket.
- Share the object URL of your cat picture with a peer. Make sure they are able to see the picture.

I did this excercise in the evening because of being sick so i used myself as a test subject. I send the link to the cat picture to myself and opened it on my phone. You will see if it worked or not below.

Below you will see my created bucket.
