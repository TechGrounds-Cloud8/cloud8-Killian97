# [Group] Retro of Week [N]

## What went well?
- we can lean on everyone more then purely leaning on Ben.
- continued positive vibe from last sprint.
- Time management and moment planning.
- The standups were very kort maar krachtig.

## What could have gone better?
- Still ask questions to multiple team members instead of asking Ben.
- 

## Individual targets.
- Archana: Work more during School hours.
- Killian: Need to find more pressure, its gone, so my motivation is less.
- Aurel: Need more short breaks during work.
- Quincy: Need more short breaks during work.
- Ben: Bitch be gone

## What can we do to improve?
- Ben is gone so we will have to ask eachother now.
- Help eachother remember to keep all the logs up to date.
