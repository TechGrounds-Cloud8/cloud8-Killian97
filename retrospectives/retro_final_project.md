# [Group] Retro of Week [N]

## What went well?
 - There was a good overal group atmosphere.
 - We had a go to person for when someone was having an issue and that person took the time to explain (mostly Ben).
 - We had realistic targets.
 - Everyone had a comfortable feeling in the group.
 - There were no major distractions during the days except project related subjects.
 - We had a professional attitude but we also talked freely about personal things, but we timed it well.
 - We had some slight hiccups but we could talk about it and solve it within the same day.

## What could have gone better?
 - We have to be carefull with explaining issues to one person and others hearing the solution before even having that issue.

## Individual targets.
- Archana: Needs to keep timelog up todate
- Killian: Get less annoyed by stuck moments, and read instead of frustration trials.
- Aurel: Review workload in Jira, and split smaller.
- Quincy: Plan what todo everyday before hand.
- Ben: Experiment more efficiently, also plan them instead of just doing them.

## What can we do to improve?
 - Do daily group timelog edits after the scrum meeting.
 - start of sprint discuss user stories.
