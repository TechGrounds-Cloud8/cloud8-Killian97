# Symmetric encryption
Learn about symmetric encryption.

## Key terminology
- ***Symmetric encryption:*** This way of encryption only uses 1 key, the sender and the receiver need to own the same key. This is a very easy way of encryption but comes with its disadvantages. One big disadvantage is that if someone finds out that 1 key, that person will have acces to all your information, for example all your encrypted emails you send to your colleague.
