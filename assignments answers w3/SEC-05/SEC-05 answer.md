# Asymmetric encryption


## Key terminology
- ***Asymmetric encryption:*** This way of encrypting uses more then just 1 key. When data needs to be encrypted it gets encrypted with a Public key and to decrypt it everyone needs their own private key that corresponds with the public key. A advantage for this encryption is that unlike the symmetric encryption the need for key sharing is gone. A disadvantage for this is that it takes more effort to set up and when someone loses their private key alot of new problems will show up, A lost key CANNOT be recovered
- ***Key pair:*** A key pair is a combination of a public key that is used to encrypt data and a private key that is used to decrypt data.
- ***RSA:*** An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The RSA public key is also used for key encryption of DES or AES DATA keys and the RSA private key for key recovery.
