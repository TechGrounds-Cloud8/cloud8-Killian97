# Asymmetric encryption


## Key terminology
- ***Asymmetric encryption:*** This way of encrypting uses more then just 1 key. When data needs to be encrypted it gets encrypted with a Public key and to decrypt it everyone needs their own private key that corresponds with the public key. A advantage for this encryption is that unlike the symmetric encryption the need for key sharing is gone. A disadvantage for this is that it takes more effort to set up and when someone loses their private key alot of new problems will show up, A lost key CANNOT be recovered
