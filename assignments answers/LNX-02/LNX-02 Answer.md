# Title 
what is assignment

## Key terminology
 - Absolute Path: Like having the “Country, State, City, Street address, floor, room, toolbox, bottom shelf, right side” for directions to where the hammer is located. Which is fine, unless we carry our tool box to into another room, and then try to retrieve the hammer. Example C:\PowerShell\ActiveDirectory\Test-ADAuthentication.ps1
 -  Relative Path: relative path is… relative to the $PWD “present working directory” Like a tool box where as long as the whole tool box is moved, the hammer is always “bottom shelf, right side”, screw driver is “top shelf center”
