## In these guides i will explain the subjects i came across in prep exam 5 and could not answer.


## Keyterms

- ***Step functions:*** Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine AWS Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business-critical applications. Through Step Functions graphical console, you see your applicationâ€™s workflow as a series of event-driven steps.

Step Functions is based on state machines and tasks. A state machine is a workflow. A task is a state in a workflow that represents a single unit of work that another AWS service performs. Each step in a workflow is a state.

- ***AWS sagemaker:*** Is a fully managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment.

- ***AWS MQ:*** Is a managed message broker service that makes it easy to migrate to a message broker in the cloud. A message broker allows software applications and components to communicate using various programming languages, operating systems, and formal messaging protocols.

- ***AWS IoT Core:*** AWS IoT provides the cloud services that connect your IoT devices to other devices and AWS cloud services. AWS IoT provides device software that can help you integrate your IoT devices into AWS IoT-based solutions. If your devices can connect to AWS IoT, AWS IoT can connect them to the cloud services that AWS provides.

- ***AWS SWF(Simple Workflow Service):*** makes it easy to build applications that coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your application. Coordinating tasks across the application involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application. Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state.

- ***AWS SES(Simple Email service):*** is an email platform that provides an easy, cost-effective way for you to send and receive email using your own email addresses and domains.

- ***Block device mapping:*** Each instance that you launch has an associated root device volume, which is either an Amazon EBS volume or an instance store volume. You can use block device mapping to specify additional EBS volumes or instance store volumes to attach to an instance when it's launched. You can also attach additional EBS volumes to a running instance; see Attach an Amazon EBS volume to an instance. However, the only way to attach instance store volumes to an instance is to use block device mapping to attach the volumes as the instance is launched.

- ***AWS ECR(Elastic Container Registry):*** Is an AWS managed container image registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM. This is so that specified users or Amazon EC2 instances can access your container repositories and images.
